These codes and scripts make Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 of the data guide paper.

There is one maser script called dataguide.sh that compiles and runs all the codes and plotting scripts. Simply type

source dataguide.sh

Before running the script you will need to download public LIGO data from the GWOSC website. The files are:

https://www.gw-openscience.org/GW150914data/P150914/fig1-residual-L.txt

You also have to download 256s of H1 data centered on GPS time 1165067917 and save it to an ASCII file called frame_256_1165067917_1.dat, 256s of L1 data centered on GPS time 1186741733 and save it to an ASCII file called frame_256_1186741733_1.dat
and 128 seconds of L1 data centered on GPS time 1166358283 and save it to an ASCII file called frame_128_1166358283_1.dat
